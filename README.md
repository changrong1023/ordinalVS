# ordinalVS
High-dimensional variable selection for ordinal outcomes with error control

Code for simulation studies is in all_in_one_simul.R. Users can run the R script by using commands in the "R CMD command" file.

all_in_one.R is for the real application which uses the data named "LiverSamples.RData".

revised_plotting.R is used for generating all plots in the manuscript.

The bayes.txt file includes the JAGS code for the Bayesian model, which is used in both simulations and the real application. The results of the Bayesian model are not presented in the manuscript due to time limit.
